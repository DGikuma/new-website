### What is Hospital Cash Insurance?

Hospital cash insurance provides you with a **daily cash benefit** during hospital admission. Unlike traditional health insurance, it doesnâ€™t pay hospitals directlyâ€”it puts money in your hands to cover:

- Lost income while admitted  
- Transport and meals for family members  
- Out-of-pocket costs not covered by NHIF or medical insurance  

### Why it matters

For many families in Kenya, even a short hospital stay can **disrupt finances**. This cover ensures you maintain dignity and stability during recovery.
